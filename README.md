* In a bid to set up an architechture that is can work as a push system, we are making and effort to
look for very basic working codes that can use websockets on nodejs to implement live data. This project
was forked from https://github.com/phatvo21/nest-chat-realtime.

* The aim of this repository is to integrate with corpdesk to develop a general push system.
- Some of the interesting features of this project include
  + capacity to isolate live interactions using socket.io
  + ability to scale the deployment using redis via socket.io-redis
